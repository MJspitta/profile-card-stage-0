        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I’m a passionate frontend developer currently honing my skills through the HNG13 internship program. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces that make digital experiences more enjoyable. My journey into web development began out of curiosity and has since grown into a genuine interest in problem-solving, design, and continuous learning. I love exploring modern JavaScript frameworks like React, experimenting with UI design, and improving my workflow with real-world projects.</p>

      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-goals">
        <h2>Goals in this program</h2>
        <p>My main goal during the HNG13 internship is to strengthen my technical foundation and gain practical, hands-on experience working in team-based environments. I want to deepen my understanding of React, improve my ability to write clean and maintainable code, and learn how to build production-ready applications efficiently. I also aim to develop better communication and collaboration skills which are essential traits for any successful developer.</p>

      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
        <p>I’m still building confidence in debugging complex issues, optimizing performance in larger applications, and integrating frontend projects with backend APIs. I sometimes struggle with structuring bigger projects and managing state effectively, but I’m actively working to improve these areas through consistent practice, code reviews, and feedback from mentors and fellow interns.</p>

      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-future-note">
        <h2>Note to future self</h2>
        <p>Keep going — even when things feel overwhelming. Remember how far you’ve come from when you first started learning to code. Every small improvement adds up, and every challenge is a step closer to mastery. Keep building, stay curious, and never lose the excitement that got you started.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h2>Extra thoughts</h2>
        <p>The HNG13 internship is more than just a program — it’s a community of learners, mentors, and creators pushing one another to grow. I’m excited to keep learning, contribute to projects that make an impact, and evolve into a confident developer who can take on bigger challenges in the tech space.</p>
